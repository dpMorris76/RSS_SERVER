Obviously needed
- Need a new html editor (any suggestions?)
- Is there any specific way you want us or suggest us to use to store the multiple links in the database?
	- json string (pref) o:
	- if another table link xref table and alter current to work in that way.  
	- probably another table, (what dana would prefer)
	
Create the ability to add a point of contact to the bottom of the story.
Auto populate with the author name and formatted phone number. 
2. For above?
Only the phone  number and the name. 

Create the ability to re-publish a story.
3. What type of thing is being republished (expired story?) 
Probably something that is currently live, and it needs to be changed on the fly, they really want on the fly editing and re publishing.  

Create the ability to warn a user that their session has timed out. 
4. Kyle will need to help with this, or someone will have to do a lot of research.

Review the expiration date process.
Review Server Side Publish Rates.
5/6: Create a documentation folder and add a .md file called storyPublishingAndExpiring.md

Create the ability to automate user registration.
7. What additional automatic user registration do we need?
Create the new user in a way similar to how the infolink client creates users, use the same permissions etc. (create a static method in userDS.java). 

Create the ability to remove a published story. 
9. Should this be on the same page as where they are directed from the email? 
Yes, probably. It can go in the same location that it is currently in, however we need the button to stand out as unpublish (red? bold?) probably with a confirm.  

Just made sense:
Create the ability to add multiple hyper links to a story. Each link should capture the URL value. The client article should display the link name. 
Create the ability to add / insert a table into the body of the story. 
Create the ability to display the channel name when reviewing or approving a story.
